  In this lesson, we will explore how to create and manipulate text files using
  Python. We'll also learn how to use shortcuts for naming files to streamline
  our coding process.


  ### Creating a Text File


  To create a text file in Python, you can use the `open()` function with the
  mode `'w'` for writing. Here's a simple example:


  ```python

  # Create a new text file

  file = open('example.txt', 'w')


  # Write some text to the file

  file.write('Hello, this is a test file.')


  # Close the file

  file.close()

  ```


  ### Reading a Text File


  To read from a text file, use the `open()` function with the mode `'r'`.
  Here's how you can read the contents of a file:


  ```python

  # Open the file for reading

  file = open('example.txt', 'r')


  # Read the contents

  content = file.read()


  # Print the contents

  print(content)


  # Close the file

  file.close()

  ```


  ### Using Shortcuts for File Names


  When working with multiple files, it's helpful to use shortcuts or variables
  for file names. This makes your code more manageable and reduces errors.
  Here's an example:


  ```python

  # Define a shortcut for the file name

  file_name = 'example.txt'


  # Open the file using the shortcut

  file = open(file_name, 'w')

  file.write('This is another test.')

  file.close()


  # Read the file using the shortcut

  file = open(file_name, 'r')

  print(file.read())

  file.close()

  ```


  ### Summary


  By using shortcuts for file names, you can easily manage and manipulate files
  in your Python projects. This approach not only saves time but also makes your
  code cleaner and more efficient.
